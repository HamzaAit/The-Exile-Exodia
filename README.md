The Exile of Exodia" is a game that exposes the user to the story of a certain Exodia, a billionaire who left Earth when the pandemic first began. The self-centered man was mostly worried about protecting himself, but looking down from above, where time moves much faster, he sees what the pandemic did to his home planet. This experience makes him realize that Earth is our irreplaceable home, and how important the responsibility of protecting it is. The game puts the player in Exodia's shoes, as he walks through his space shuttle, looking down on Earth from its many windows. In the game, each window along the corridor shows one of four different countries, in one of two different timestamps.
